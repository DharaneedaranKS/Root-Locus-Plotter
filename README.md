# Root-Locus-Plotter
Small Assignment I found interesting

So my class was tasked by our professor to write a code on MATLAB or python without using the control ToolBox or the library in python. Hence this python program that I have written in a very simplified form and took some inspiration from Kevin Zakka (github profile: https://github.com/kevinzakka).
